## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.
- Because the variable is declared 2 times , first time declared outside of the function as a globale variable and 2nd time inside the function's scope which is prioritised over the global variable when they have the same name

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
- it will log 10 and then throw an error, x is a global variable and y is within scope of the function and cannot be used outside of it. 

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
First 9, because f1 increments a parameter which is in that function's scope, not x (global variable). 
Second { x: 10}, because objects are passed as references so the funtion modifies the original object
